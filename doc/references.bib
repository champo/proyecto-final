  abstract = {The research reported in this article is part of an ambitious,
mid-term project that studies the automated analysis of football games.
The input for game analysis is position data provided by tiny microwave senders
that are placed into the ball and the shin guards of football players. The
main objectives of the project are (1) the investigation of novel computational
mechanisms that enable computer systems to recognize intentional activities
based on position data, (2) the development of an integrated software system to
automate game interpretation and analysis, and (3) the demonstration of the
impact of automatic game analysis on sport science, football coaching, and
sports entertainment. The results are to be showcased in the form of an
intelligent information system for the matches at the Football World
Championship 2006 in Germany.}
